# Iris-classification-using-naive-bayes-model
Classification of Iris dataset using naive bayes model and checking the prediction accuracy using confusion matrix.

Data set is imported from https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/iris

IDE used: atom with hydrogen.

libraries used are Pandas for dataframe manipulation, Numpy for array manipulation and sklearn for train test split, naive bayes, confusion matrix and standard scailer.

The code is divided into sub modules for easy understanding. first the data is imorted and then divided into training and testing set using train test split, this split data is then homogenized and fitting and prediction is done. Finally the accuracy of the prediction is measured using confusion matrix.
